# security-policy-templates

A set of foundational but comprehensive policies, standards and procedures
designed for cloud-native technology organizations. The policy package covers
the requirements and controls for most compliance frameworks and best practices,
in a lightweight approach.

They can be used as stand-alone documents. But the structure is designed to be
best suited for use with the [`jupiter-policy-builder` CLI][builder] and the
**policies** app on the **[JupiterOne][j1]** platform.

These are used internally at JupiterOne Security.

## TL;DR

Run the following command to install the policy builder and build the policies.
You will be prompted for a few inputs, such as company name, to be included in
your policy text.

```bash
npm install -g @jupiterone/jupiter-policy-builder

psp build -t ./templates
```

You will be prompted to save the config to a file, which you can reference the
next time you'd like to rebuild the policies and procedures:

```bash
psp build -t ./templates -c path/to/your/config.json
```

The result files are put in `./docs` (Markdown) and `./site` (HTML).

**IMPORTANT:** To edit the policies and procedures, use the template files in
`./templates` and re-run the `psp build` command. Do _not_ edit the `./docs` and
`./partials` files directly as they will be overwritten on the next build.

For more detailed builder instructions, see the README [here][builder].

## Format

Similar to the concept of "micro-services", the policies and procedures are
written in "micro-docs" that are decoupled from the policies. They are mapped
to each other via a JSON configuration.

- All policies, procedures and reference documents are written in **Markdown**.
- All configuration files are in **JSON** format, including mapping between
  policies and procedures, and between procedures and compliance standards.

## Structure

`templates/policies`

- This directory contains the modular templates for policies.
- Each policy document is written in the following structure:

    ```markdown
    # Policy Title

    `revision`

    Overview of the policy. A paragraph or two to describe the intent and
    principals of the policy.

    ## Policy Statements

    This section contains the high level requirements specific to the policy.

    Policy statements are aligned to the organization's operating model and
    applicable compliance requirements. These statements describe the "what"
    but not the "how". They are meant to be stable over longer periods of time 
    without needing frequent updates.
    ```

`templates/procedures`

- This directory contains the modular templates for controls and procedures.
- Each procedure is considered a "micro-document" that describes how a specific
  control is implemented to address the requirements in the policy that it
  implements.
- Each procedure document is written in the following structure:

    ```markdown
    ### Control/Procedure Title

    Overview. A few lines to describe the control and procedure.

    Detailed text.

    #### Sub-section as needed

    More text.
    ```

  > Note that the **Title** is a _level 3 heading_. This is because the
  `policy-builder` tool will automatically combine the procedures and policies
  they each implement to a single document for publishing, and it will insert a
  `## Controls and Procedures` section heading after the **Policy Statements**
  section and before the first control/procedure.

`templates/ref`

- This directory contains the modular templates for reference documents.
- The reference documents are similar to control procedures. At build/publish
  time, they will be combined and attached to the **Addendum and References**
  document by the `policy-builder`

`templates/assessments`

- This directory contains templates for assessment reports.
- The only available report template at the moment is for a HIPAA risk assessment.
- The `jupiter-policy-builder` CLI tool can leverage this template to
  auto-generate a self assessment report based on the adoption of policies and
  procedures.

## Configuration and Mapping

`config.json { organization }`

There are variables (e.g. `companyFullName`) defined throughout the template
documents. These variables make it easy to adopt and maintain the policy set by
configuring the variables at one place -- in the `organization` section of
`config.json`.

JupiterOne's policy builder (both the web app and CLI) makes use of this
configuration to build the final policy set.

`config.json { policies }`

The `policies` section is a repository of the policy modules. Each entry is
defined with the following:

- `id` - typically matches the filename of the policy without the extension
- `file` - path to the markdown module (without the `.tmpl` extension)
- `name` - policy name, which typically matches the title in the policy doc
- `adopted` - a `boolean` flag to indicate if the policy has been adopted by the
  organization
- `procedures` - an array that contains the procedure modules that
  implement/enforce this policy.

Similar to the concept of "micro-services", the policies and procedures are
written in "micro-docs" that are decoupled from the policies. They are mapped
to each other via the above configuration.

`config.json { procedures }`

The `procedures` section is a repository of the procedure modules. Each entry is
defined with the following:

- `id` - typically matches the filename of the procedures without the extension
- `file` - path to the markdown module (without the `.tmpl` extension)
- `name` - procedure name, which typically matches the title in the procedure doc
- `type` - specifies one of the following procedure types:
  - `administrative`
  - `technical`
  - `operational`
  - `physical`
  - `informative`
- `provider` - name of the control provider (e.g. "AWS IAM")
- `summary` - provides guidance to the document author specific to that procedure
- `applicable` - a `boolean` that specifies whether the procedure is applicable
  to the organization based on its operational and compliance requirements
- `adopted` - a `boolean` flag to indicate if the policy has been adopted by the
  organization

`config.json { references }`

Similar to procedures, the `references` section is a repository of additional
documentation. Each entry is defined with the following:

- `id` - typically matches the filename of the procedures without the extension
- `file` - path to the markdown module (without the `.tmpl` extension)
- `name` - document name, which typically matches the title in the procedure doc
- `applicable` - a `boolean` that specifies whether the document is applicable
  to the organization based on its operational and compliance requirements
- `adopted` - a `boolean` flag to indicate if the policy has been adopted by the
  organization

### Compliance Mapping

`standards/controls-mapping.json`

The `controls-mapping.json` document configures a mapping of each procedure to
one or more security/compliance frameworks, as applicable.

Note that the controls mapping is only between a control/procedure document to
the requirement, not at the policy level. This is because we strongly believe
that you must have documented controls and procedures to implement and enforce a
high level written policy. Having a written policy by itself without 
implementation or enforcement does not address the risk of any security
or compliance requirement.

Internally at JupiterOne, we leverage CIS Controls and PCI DSS. JupiterOne's
parent company, LifeOmic, builds a suite of healthcare related software products
and is therefore under HIPAA regulation and has adopted HITRUST CSF.

The JSON documents for those four frameworks are included strictly because of
our internal usage and shown as examples. Using those requires that you have
obtained necessary end-user license for the framework for your own organization.

### Scripts

`parse_oscal.py`

The scripts included in this repository take a well-maintained source on the web and transform it into a format that the Compliance App can parse to provide a baseline or standard to application users.  Most of them require arguments, and need to be run manually before creating a PR to merge updates into the main branch.  So, the general process is:
1. Clone the repository, or pull updates from the main branch
2. Checkout a branch on which to build your updates
3. Run the script, providing the necessary arguments (run with -h to figure out what those are)
4. Add the changed files to a commit and push it to the origin for review
5. Once reviewed, merge and update in the app itself.
