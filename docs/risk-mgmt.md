# Risk Management

`2020.1`

This policy establishes the scope, objectives, and procedures of 's
information security risk management process. The risk management process is
intended to support and protect the organization and its ability to fulfill its
mission.

## Policy Statements

 policy requires that:

(a) A thorough risk assessment must be conducted to evaluate the potential
threats and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
of electronic protected health information (ePHI) (and other confidential and
proprietary electronic information) it stores, transmits, and/or processes.

(b) Risk assessments must be performed with any major change to 's
business or technical operations and/or supporting infrastructure, no less than
once per year.

(c) Strategies shall be developed to mitigate or accept the risks identified in
the risk assessment process.

(d) Maintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk
mitigation efforts for a minimum of seven years.


## Controls and Procedures


### Risk Management Objectives

 has established formal risk analysis and risk management
processes to

- identify risks that may impact its business operations or the confidentiality,
  integrity and availability of its critical data; and

- reduce risk to an acceptable level by implementation of mitigation controls.

Unmitigated risk above the pre-defined acceptable level must be reviewed,
approved and accepted by senior management.

#### Acceptable Risk Levels

Risks that are either low impact or low probability, based on the scoring
mechanism defined in [risk assessment process](cp-risk-assess.md), are generally
considered acceptable.

All other risks must be individually reviewed and managed according to the
[risk management process](cp-risk-mgmt.md).


### Risk Management Process

Risk analysis and risk management are recognized as important components of
's corporate compliance program and information security program in
accordance with the Risk Analysis and Risk Management implementation
specifications within the Security Management standard and the evaluation
standards set forth in the HIPAA Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A),
164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B), 164.308(a)(1)(i), and 164.308(a)(8).

Risk assessments are done throughout product life cycles:

  * Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are
    made to  physical and technical safeguards; and (Note that these
    changes do not include routine updates to existing systems, deployments of
    new systems created based on previously configured systems, deployments of
    new Customers, or new code developed for operations and management of the
     Platform)
  * While making changes to  physical equipment and facilities that
    introduce new, untested configurations.

 performs periodic technical and non-technical assessments of the
security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or
operational changes affecting the security of ePHI.

 implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and
vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:

  1. Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI
      receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its
     Customers;
  2. Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the
     security or integrity of Customer ePHI;
  3. Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer
     ePHI that are not permitted or required; and
  4. Ensure compliance by all workforce members.

In addition to the policy requirements stated in 4.1,  risk management
process requires that:

1. Any risk remaining (residual) after other risk controls have been applied,
   requires sign off by the senior management and 's Security Officer.
2. All  workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all
   persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and
   audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be
   subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation, as
   outlined in the  Roles Policy.
3. The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security
   risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of 's
   Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk
   Management Team.
4. All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put
   in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the
   documentation is maintained for six years.
5. The details of the Risk Management Process, including risk assessment,
   discovery, and mitigation, are outlined in detail below. The process is
   tracked, measured, and monitored using the following procedures:

    1. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer initiates the Risk Management
       Procedures by creating an Issue in the  Security Project.
    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to carry out the
       Risk Management Procedures.
    3. All findings are documented and linked to the Issue.
    4. Once the Risk Assessment steps are complete, along with corresponding
       documentation, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the
       Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
    5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as
       Done, adding any pertinent notes required.

6. The Risk Management Procedure is monitored on a quarterly basis using 
   reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

Third party risk management details including procurement and systems
acquisition can be found in [§vendor](vendor.md).

#### Risk Management Schedule

The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment
and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to
ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of 's
information security program:

* Scheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of 's information system
  infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be
  completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be
  determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.

* Throughout a System's Development Life Cycle - from the time that a need for a
  new, untested information system configuration and/or application is
  identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the
  potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as
  a part of the maintenance of the system.

* As Needed - the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk
  Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to
  changes in business strategies, information technology, information
  sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that
  affect 's Platform.


### Risk Assessment and Analysis

The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and
vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of
this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating
risk.

* Step 1. System Characterization

    * The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To
      do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or
      transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the  Platform
      boundaries are identified.

    * Output - Characterization of the  Platform system assessed, a good
      picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform
      boundaries.

* Step 2. Threat Identification

    * Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully
      exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All
      potential threat-sources through the review of historical incidents and
      data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., to help generate a
      list of potential threats.

    * Output - A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could
      exploit Platform vulnerabilities.

* Step 3. Vulnerability Identification

    * Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities
      that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources.
      Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that
      govern an organization's computer usage to insufficient safeguards to
      protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of
      software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization's
      computer network.

    * Output - A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could
      be exercised by potential threat-sources.

* Step 4. Control Analysis

    * Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical
      controls that have been or will be implemented by  to minimize or
      eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a
      Platform vulnerability.

    * Output - List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures,
      training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to
      mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the
      impact of such an adverse event.

* Step 5. Likelihood Determination

    * Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability
      that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the
      existing or planned security controls.

    * Output - Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to
      the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 6. Impact Analysis

    * Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat
      successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems
      to consider should include the importance to 's mission;
      sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss
      of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.

    * Output - Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high
      (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 7. Risk Determination

    * Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood
      determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This
      represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or
      procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The
      risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for
      each risk level.

    * Output - Risk level of low (1-10), medium (>10-50) or high (>50-100).
      Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.

* Step 8. Control Recommendations

    * Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as
      appropriate to the organization's operations to an acceptable level.
      Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of
      recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and
      regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and
      reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation
      process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security
      controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.

    * Output - Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to
      mitigate risk.

* Step 9. Results Documentation

    * Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report,
      spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make
      decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and
      management changes.

    * Output - A risk assessment report that describes the threats and
      vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for
      control implementation.

### Risk Mitigation and Monitoring

Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the
appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process
to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of  Platform
ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the
risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.

* Step 1. Prioritize Actions

    * Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and
      vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order.
      This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with
      the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate
      attention and top priority in allocating resources

    * Output - Actions ranked from high to low

* Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options

    * Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are
      arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended
      control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and
      appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance,
      etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk
      mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end,
      select a "most appropriate" control option for each threat and
      vulnerability pair.

    * Output - list of feasible controls

* Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis

    * Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the
      benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent
      cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also
      identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in
      this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can
      greatly aid in the decision-making process.

    * Output - Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not
      implementing each specific control

* Step 4. Select Control(s)

    * Taking into account the information and results from previous steps,
      's mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team
      determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information
      systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI.
      These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or
      technical safeguards.

    * Output - Selected control(s)

* Step 5. Assign Responsibility

    * Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each
      of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their
      responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other
      resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources
      may include time, money, equipment, etc.

    * Output - List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments

* Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan

    * Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project
      plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The
      Implementation Plan should contain the following information:

        * Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;
        * Prioritized actions;
        * The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;
        * Required resources for implementation of selected controls;
        * Team member responsible for implementation of each control;
        * Start date for implementation
        * Target date for completion of implementation;
        * Maintenance requirements.

    * The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard
      implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource
      requirements (staff and other individuals' time, budget, etc.),
      interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information.
      Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success
      indicators should be reported to  Senior Management.

    * Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and
      contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet
      implementation timeframe and expectations. Additionally, consider
      including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a
      list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and
      project requirements.

    * Output - Safeguard Implementation Plan

* Step 7. Implement Selected Controls

    * As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that
      the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all
      risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented
      controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.

    * Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk
      Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people
      throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are
      identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate
      it.

    * Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major
      environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major
      facilities changes.

    * If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of
      the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower
      risk to an acceptable level can be identified.

    * Output - Residual Risk documentation

### Risk Registry

 Security team maintains a registry of risks, captured and kept updated

* in a document on company SharePoint; and/or
* in the security operations tool/database.

The risk registry includes all risks and threats identified during annual risk
assessment and all interim reviews.

### Cyber Liability Insurance
