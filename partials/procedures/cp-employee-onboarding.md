### Employee Onboarding Procedures

A master checklist for employee onboarding is maintained by HR/Facilities.  
It is published in the HR system or the HR folder on
['s internal file sharing site](#).

The HR Representative / Facility Manager is responsible to create an Issue in
the  HR & Facilities project to initiate and track the
onboarding process. The onboarding process should include the following
IT/Security items:

1. Training.

    * New workforce member is provided training on  security policy,
      acceptable use policy, HIPAA awareness, and given access to the Employee
      Handbook.
    * Records of training and policy acceptance is kept in the HR system
      (currently EaseCentral).
    * The training and acceptance must be completed within 30 days of
      employment.

2. Access.

    * Standard access is provisioned according to the job role and approval as
      specified in the HR onboarding  ticket.
    * Non-standard access requires additional approval following the access
      request procedures.
    * Request for modifications of access for any  employee
      can be made using the procedures outlined in the
      [Access Establishment and Modification policy and procedures](access.md).

3. System configuration.

    * The end-user computing device (e.g. workstation or laptop) may be
      provisioned by IT to install necessary software, malware protection,
      security agents, and setting system configurations.
    * Users in a technical role, such as Development, may choose to self
      configure their system. In this case, the user is given configuration
      guidelines defined by IT and Security. The system must have the required
      security configuration and endpoint agents installed for monitoring and to
      ensure compliance.
