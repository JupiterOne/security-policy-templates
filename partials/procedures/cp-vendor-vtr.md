### Vendor Technology Risk Review

 security policy requires a risk review of vendor
technology, prior to any technology being integrated to 
operations and/or infrastructure. Employees are required to engage security team
to conduct such review. The request may be submitted by email directly to the
security team, or by opening a  ticket through the
 internal service desk.

Security team is responsible to conduct the reviews via interviews and reviews
of documentation, to ensure the vendor complies with regulatory requirements
such as HIPAA and follows security best practices to minimize risk to an
acceptable level.

A vendor technology risk (VTR) assessment is conducted using Google VSAQ, in
the following steps:

1. Reviewer sends questionnaire link(s) to vendor contact.
1. Vendor completes the questionnaire(s).
1. Vendor saves/exports answers to the assessment questionnaire(s).
1. Vendor contact sends the answers file back to reviewer.
1. Reviewer opens the same questionnaire(s) and loads the answers received from
   the vendor to complete the assessment.
1. Reviewer follows up with vendor contact as needed.
1. Reviewer facilities discussion with business owner to determine if the risk
   is acceptable. Vendor remediation may be required depending on the results.

A list of [approved vendors / contractors][1] is maintained by the Security and
Operations teams.
