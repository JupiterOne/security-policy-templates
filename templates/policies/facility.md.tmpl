# Facility Access and Physical Security

`{{defaultRevision}}`

It is the goal of {{companyShortName}} to provide a safe and secure environment for all
employees. Access to the {{companyShortName}} facilities is limited to authorized
individuals only.

{{companyShortName}} works with Subcontractors (e.g. property management companies and IU
facilities management) to assure restriction of physical access to systems used
as part of the {{companyShortName}} Platform. {{companyShortName}} and its Subcontractors control access
to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or
in which {{companyShortName}} workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA Security
Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. Physical Access to all of
{{companyShortName}} facilities is limited to only those authorized in this policy. In an
effort to safeguard ePHI from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access
is allowed to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with
escorts for unauthorized persons. All workforce members are responsible for
reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or unauthorized access to
{{companyShortName}}'s facility.

!!! Note

    * Platform. {{companyShortName}} does not have ready access to ePHI, it provides cloud-based, compliant infrastructure to covered entities and business associates. {{companyShortName}} does not physically house any systems used by its Platform in {{companyShortName}} facilities. Physical security of our Platform servers is ensured by our infrastructure service provider such as AWS.

    * Lab. {{companyShortName}} NGS Lab uses a cloud-based laboratory information management system (LIMS) to manage and track the lab process. Physical security of the LIMS systems is ensured by our software service provider Illumina. The physical security of the lab equipment and supporting IT infrastructure that generates and processes genomic data is outlined in this policy.
