### Testing and Maintenance

The COO and/or Head of Engineering shall establish criteria for
validation/testing of a Contingency Plan, an annual test schedule, and ensure
implementation of the test. This process will also serve as training for
personnel involved in the plan's execution. At a minimum the Contingency Plan
shall be tested annually (within 365 days). The types of validation/testing
exercises include tabletop and technical testing. Contingency Plans for all
application systems must be tested at a minimum using the tabletop testing
process. However, if the application system Contingency Plan is included in the
technical testing of their respective support systems that technical test will
satisfy the annual requirement.

#### Tabletop Testing

Tabletop Testing is conducted in accordance with
[CMS's RMH Chapter 6 Supplemental Contingency Planning Exercise Procedures](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/InformationSecurity/Downloads/RMH-Chapter-6-Supplemental-Contingency-Planning-Exercise-Procedures.docx).
The primary objective of the tabletop test is to ensure designated personnel are
knowledgeable and capable of performing the notification/activation requirements
and procedures as outlined in the CP, in a timely manner. The exercises include,
but are not limited to:

* Testing to validate the ability to respond to a crisis in a coordinated,
  timely, and effective manner, by simulating the occurrence of a specific
  crisis.

#### Simulation and/or Technical Testing

The primary objective of the technical test is to ensure the communication
processes and data storage and recovery processes can function at an alternate
site to perform the functions and capabilities of the system within the
designated requirements. Technical testing shall include, but is not limited to:

* Process from backup system at the alternate site;
* Restore system using backups; and
* Switch compute and storage resources to alternate processing site.
