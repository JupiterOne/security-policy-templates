### Policy Management Process

#### Document Structure

Policies are written in individual documents, each pertaining to a specific
domain of concern.

Each document starts with the current version number in the format of `YYYY.#`
(e.g. `2017.1`), followed by a brief summary.  The remaining of the document is
structured to contain the following subsections:

* Policy Statements
* Applicable Standards
* Controls and Procedures

#### Versioning

Each {{companyShortName}} policy document contains a version and optionally a
revision number. The version number is the four digit year followed by a number,
to indicate the year and sequence number of the policy at which time it was
written or updated.

The version number shall be incremented by one with each material change to the
policy content.  For example, if a new policy statement is added or a technical
control/procedure is updated to `2017.1` version of a policy, the new version
should be numbered `2017.2`.

The policy document may also include a revision number, in the format of
`rev.#`, immediately following the main version number. A revision number
indicate minor, non-material changes to the document, such as formatting
changes, fixing typos, or adding minor details.

#### Numbering

If sequencing numbers are included in the policy headings:

* Policy may be referenced by its statement number, such as `§2.1(a)`, in
  internal/external communications as well as in other {{companyShortName}} policies or
  technical/business documentation for cross reference.

* As such, to maintain cross referencing integrity, starting from version
  `2017.2`, all numbering shall remain intact for policy documents and
  statements.

* When updating, avoid reordering and renumbering of policy documents and
  statements. For example:

    - Append at the end of the list by adding new statement(s) as needed instead
      of inserting.
    - If a policy or policy statement is no longer applicable, mark it
      deprecated instead of removing the file or statement completely.

#### Review and Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and up to date to maintain {{companyShortName}} compliance with
   {{#needStandardHIPAA}}HIPAA,{{/needStandardHIPAA}}
   {{#needStandardPCI}}PCI,{{/needStandardPCI}}
   {{#needStandardNIST}}NIST,{{/needStandardNIST}}
   SOC 2 and other relevant standards. Updates and version
   control are done similar to source code control.

2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time.
   Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by the Security and Privacy
   Officer to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.

3. {{companyShortName}} employees may request changes to policies using the following
   process:

    1. The {{companyShortName}} employee initiates a policy change request by creating an
       Issue in the {{ticketingSystem}} Security project. The change request may optionally
       include a {{sourceControl}} pull request from a separate branch or
       repository containing the desired changes.

    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the
       policy change request.

    3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects
       the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and
       documentation.

    4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as
       Done, adding any pertinent notes required.

    5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production
       systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using
       {{companyShortName}}'s [change management process](ccm.md).

    6. If the change results in a new version instead of a new revision (see
       §3.3.1 for definitions), the current version of the policy document(s)
       must be saved to archive under the corresponding version number prior to
       the new policy being adopted/published and prior to merging the pull
       request containing the changes. This allows easy reference to previous
       versions if necessary.

    !!! important

        * Changes are made on the `drafts` (or equivalent) branch instead of on the `master` branch for commits.
        * If multiple authors are working on the changes, additional separate branches and pull requests may be necessary before changes are merged in `drafts`.
        * Changes must not be merged to `master` without the approval of Security and Privacy Officer.
        * Changes must not be merged to `master` without archiving the existing version of policy document(s), unless the change is a minor revision.
        * Once the changes are final and approved, a pull request shall be created from the `drafts` branch to the `master` branch and all members of the development team shall be included as approvers.  This serves as communication and training of policy updates to the development organization, and the pull request approvals serve as records of training received.
        * Policy update communication and training for non-development staff is conducted separately by the Security team.

4. All policies are made accessible to all {{companyShortName}} workforce members. The
   current master policies are published at
   [{{&securityPolicyURL}}]({{&securityPolicyURL}}).

    * Changes are automatically communicated to all {{companyShortName}} team members
      through integrations between {{sourceControl}} and Slack that log changes
      to a predefined {{companyShortName}} Slack Channel.
    * The Security Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees via
      email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change
      using terminology appropriate for the target audience.

5. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 7 years from the
   date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is
   later

     1. Version history of all {{companyShortName}} policies is done via {{sourceControl}}.
     2. Backup storage of all policies is done with AWS S3 and/or internal file
        share (e.g. Microsoft Office365 SharePoint or Box).

6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited
   annually, or after significant changes occur to {{companyShortName}}'s
   organizational environment, by the security committee members. Issues that
   come up as part of this process are reviewed by {{companyShortName}}
   management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully
   addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:

    1. The Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in
       the {{ticketingSystem}} Security project or via a Pull Request (PR).
    2. The Security Committee members and additional reviewers are notified by
       email or via the PR to review the current policies.
    3. If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are
       documented in the Issue/PR.
    4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects
       the Issue/PR. If the Issue/PR is rejected, it goes back for further
       review and documentation.
    5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as
       Done, or merges the PR into master branch, adding any pertinent notes
       required.
    6. Policy review is monitored using {{ticketingSystem}} or {{sourceControl}}
       reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

7. {{companyShortName}} utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the
   HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. {{companyShortName}} also tracks compliance annually.
   In order to track and measure adherence on an annual basis, {{companyShortName}} uses the
   following process to track HITRUST audits, both full and interim:

    1. The Security Officer initiates the HITRUST audit activity by creating an
       Issue in {{companyShortName}} {{ticketingSystem}} Security project.
    2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage
       the HITRUST activity.
    3. Once the HITRUST activity is completed, the Security Officer approves or
       rejects the Issue.
    4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as
       Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
    5. Compliance with annual compliance assessments, utilizing the HITRUST CSF
       as a framework, is monitored on a quarterly basis to assess compliance
       with above policy.
