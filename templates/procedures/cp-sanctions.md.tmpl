### Non-Compliance Investigation and Sanctions

Workforce members shall report non-compliance of {{companyShortName}}'s policies and
procedures to the Security Officer or other individual as assigned by the
Security Officer. Individuals that report violations in good faith may not be
subjected to intimidation, threats, coercion, discrimination against, or any
other retaliatory action as a consequence.

1. The Security Officer promptly facilitates a thorough investigation of all
   reported violations of {{companyShortName}}'s security policies and procedures. The
   Security Officer may request the assistance from others.

    * Complete an audit trail/log to identify and verify the violation and
      sequence of events.
    * Interview any individual that may be aware of or involved in the incident.
    * All individuals are required to cooperate with the investigation process
      and provide factual information to those conducting the investigation.
    * Provide individuals suspected of non-compliance of the Security rule
      and/or {{companyShortName}}'s policies and procedures the opportunity to explain their
      actions.
    * The investigator thoroughly documents the investigation as the
      investigation occurs. This documentation must include a list of all
      employees involved in the violation.

2. Violation of any security policy or procedure by workforce members may result
   in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of
   employment. Violation of this policy and procedures by others, including
   business associates, customers, and partners may result in termination of the
   relationship and/or associated privileges. Violation may also result in civil
   and criminal penalties as determined by federal and state laws and
   regulations.

    * A fair disciplinary process will be utilized for employees are suspected
      of committing breaches of security. Multiple factors will be considered
      when deciding the response such as whether or not this was a first
      offense, training, business contracts, etc.
    * {{companyShortName}} reserves the right to terminate employees in the case of serious
      cases of misconduct.
    * A violation resulting in a breach of confidentiality (i.e. release of
      sensitive data to an unauthorized individual), change of the data
      integrity, or inability to access data by other users, requires immediate
      termination of the workforce member from {{companyShortName}}.

3. The Security Officer facilitates taking appropriate steps to prevent
   recurrence of the violation (when possible and feasible).

4. In the case of an insider threat, the Security Officer and Privacy Officer
   are to set up a team to investigate and mitigate the risk of insider
   malicious activity. {{companyShortName}} workforce members are encouraged to come forward
   with information about insider threats, and can do so anonymously.

5. The Security Officer maintains all documentation of the investigation,
   sanctions provided, and actions taken to prevent reoccurrence for a minimum
   of seven years after the conclusion of the investigation.

6. When the Security Officer identifies a violation and begins a formal
   sanction process, they will notify the appropriate management or supervisors
   within 24 hours. That notification will include 1) identifying the
   individual sanctioned, 2) the reason for the sanction, and 3) specific
   procedures for service or account restriction / revocation or other
   disciplinary actions as required.
