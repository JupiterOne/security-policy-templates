### HIPAA Best Practices for Software Development

#### Use only HIPAA eligible services in the Cloud (AWS)

Because we use the services provided by AWS for our production environment with
contains electronic protected health information (ePHI), AWS is a "business
associate" of ours.  It is required by HIPAA for {{companyShortName}} and AWS to
enter into a ["business associate agreement" (BAA)][BAA].

[BAA]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/tag/aws-business-associate-agreement/

Our fully executed BAA with AWS can be found on the internal document repository.

We must only used HIPAA-eligible services covered under the BAA to
process and store ePHI.  Non-eligible services may be used in support
of our cloud infrastructure as long as it does not have access to
ePHI.

A list of HIPAA eligible services can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/).
AWS regularly updates its services to meet HIPAA compliance
requirements.  Check the page once in a while to find out if new
services have been added.

#### Separate access and data between prod and non-prod accounts

It is a compliance requirement of multiple regulations to ensure
separation of duties between production and non-production
environments, including both access and data.  Additionally, we should
not use production data for dev or test, unless the data has been
properly sanitized/masked.

Examples of regulations and certifications that have this explicit
requirement include HIPAA, SAS70/SSAE-17, SOC, PCI, and ISO
27001/27002, many of which are on our target list to be compliant with
or certified to.  

#### Do not log ePHI

Not only it is a security best practice to avoid sensitive data such
as ePHI in application logging, it may be a contract violation (per
AWS BAA) to do so.  We must not send any ePHI to non HIPAA eligible
services in AWS, such as CloudTrail.

#### Include the right language in notices

Specific language must be included in terms, consents, and notices.
For example, we must collect email addresses from patients when they
sign up for the PHC, and specify in the terms that we may use the
email address provided as a formal method of communication, including
breach notification, should a breach occurs that impact their PHI.

#### Data protection

Follow the requirements listed in the following documents:

- [Data Classification Model](data-mgmt.md#data-classification-model);
- [Data Handling Requirements](data-mgmt.md#data-handling-requirements-matrix);
- [Data Protection Policy and Procedures](data-protection.md); and
- [Backup and Recovery Process](data-mgmt.md#backup-and-recovery).
