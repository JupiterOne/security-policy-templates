## Employee Handbook and Policy Quick Reference

`{{defaultRevision}}`

This is an abridged version of {{companyShortName}}'s security policy that all
workforce members are required to be familiar with and comply with.

You are assumed to have read and fully understood the corporate security and
privacy policies, standards, guidelines, controls and procedures even if you
haven’t. So, it’s probably best you still go through the whole thing at some
point.

{{#needStandardHIPAA}}
* First and foremost, as a Health IT provider, {{companyShortName}} and all
  its employees must fully comply with HIPAA Security and Privacy regulations.
  All workforce members much complete the required HIPAA training.
{{/needStandardHIPAA}}

* You are required to follow detailed procedures defined in certain policies
  related to your job role.

Security is everyone's responsibility.  If this is not your first job, don’t do
anything that might get you in trouble at your previous workplace.  When in
doubt, stop and ask.

system access controls and procedures for remote access.

(b) Use of {{companyShortName}} computing systems is subject to monitoring by
{{companyShortName}} IT and/or Security team.

(c) Employees may not leave computing devices (including laptops and smart
devices) used for business purpose, including company-provided and BYOD devices,
unattended in public.

(d) Device encryption must be enabled for all mobile devices accessing company
data, such as whole-disk encryption for all laptops.

(e) Use only legal, [approved software](approved-software.md) with a valid
license. Do not use personal software for business purposes and vice versa.

(f) Encrypt all email messages containing sensitive or confidential data.

(g) Employees may not post any sensitive or confidential data in public forums
or chat rooms. If a posting is needed to obtain technical support, data must be
sanitized to remove any sensitive or confidential information prior to posting.

(h) Anti-malware or equivalent protection and monitoring must be installed and
enabled on all endpoint systems that are commonly affected by malware, including
workstations, laptops and servers.

(i) All data storage devices and media must be managed according to the {{companyShortName}}

environments.

{{#needStandardHIPAA}}

devices, including laptops, workstations and mobile devices.
{{/needStandardHIPAA}}

### Your responsibilities for computing devices

{{companyShortName}} provides company-issued laptops and workstations to all employees.
{{companyShortName}} currently does not require or support employees bringing their own
computing devices.

The laptops and/or workstations assigned to you are yours to configure and
manage according to company security policy and standards. You are responsible
to

* configure the system to meeting the [configuration and management
  requirements](ccm.md), including password policy, screen protection timeout,
  host firewall, etc.;

* ensure the required anti-malware protection and security monitoring agent is
  installed and running; and

* install the latest security patches timely or enable auto-update.

IT and Security provides automated scripts for end-user system configurations
and/or technical assistance as needed.

You are also responsible for maintaining a backup copy of the business files
local on your laptop/workstation to the appropriate location on
{{companyShortName}} file sharing / team site (e.g. SharePoint). Examples of
business files include, but are not limited to:

* Documents (e.g. product specs, business plans)
* Presentations
* Reports and spreadsheets
* Design files/images/diagrams
* Meeting notes/recordings
* Important records (e.g. approval notes)

!!! important

    DO NOT backup critical data such as customer data or PII to file sharing sites.
    If you have such critical data locally on your device, contact IT and
    Security for the appropriate data management and protection solution.

Unless the local workstation/device has access to **Critical** data, backups of
user workstations/devices are self managed by the device owner. Backups may be
stored on an external hard drive or using a cloud service such as iCloud if and
only if the data is both encrypted and password protected (passwords must meet
{{companyShortName}} requirements).

### Getting help

Support for most of our business applications are self-service, such as password
reset via Okta.

If needed, users may use our internal service desk to request IT and Security
support.  Common requests include:

* Password reset and access requests
* Request new software and hardware
* Technical support
* Recommend changes to policies and processes

### How to report an incident or suspicious activity

You are responsible to report all suspicious activities and security-related
incidents immediately to the Information Security team, by one of the following
channels:

* (preferred) “Report a security incident” by creating an issue on
  {{ticketingSystem}} and/or via the
  [internal help desk]({{&interalHelpDeskURL})

* If access to JIRA is not available, employees may send an email to
  [security@{{companyEmailDomain}}](mailto:security@{{companyEmailDomain}})

* For non-sensitive, non-confidential security issues and concerns, employees
  may post questions on {{companyShortName}}’s #infosec Slack channel.

* Additionally, employees may report the incident to their direct manager.

* To report a concern under the Whistleblower Policy, you may first discuss the
  concerns with your immediate manager, or report it directly to the CEO or COO.
  *See the [Whistleblower Policy section in the HR Security Policy][5] for
  additional details.*
